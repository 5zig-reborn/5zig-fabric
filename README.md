# 5zig -> Fabric patcher

This makes loading 5zig on Fabric possible by patching the JAR at runtime.

## Usage
1. Download the project from the [Releases](releases) tab.
2. Put the file you downloaded **and** the relative [5zig](https://github.com/5zig-reborn/The-5zig-Mod) file in
the `.minecraft/mods` folder.
3. Run Minecraft.
    * The patcher should run and you should receive a confirmation message prompting you to restart your game.
    * Click on `Restart Now`.
4. If everything went correctly, The 5zig Mod should now load and the "unpatched" 5zig file should be deleted
from your `mods` folder.
